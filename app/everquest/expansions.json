Although puzzled by the realm of chaos and unsure if the risks were worth it, the Wayfarers Brotherhood moved forward with their expedition into Kuua. Unlike the nihilites of Taelosia, the brotherhood was prepared for what lied ahead. Kuua was once quite similar to Norrath. It is the home of the Dragorn. Carved from the heartiest of earth and stone by the great dragon, Dranik, the peaceful existence of these noble beings was shattered by the influence of Discord as shades of darkness grew over the continent, opening the door for the invading legion of Mata Muram. Upon this dark taint on Kuua, all races began fighting one another -- wars which were responsible for the ashen sky which still, to this day, looms over the continent. By this point, the dragorn stopped their travels and fortified themselves within the walls of Dranik, fighting off all outsiders. There is a number of Dragorn who were exiled from Dranik before and after the influence of Discord caused fighting among the race. The exiles are often on the outskirts of the city in the caves of Dranik's Scar or other outlying areas. They have attempted to organize and overthrow the High Council several times with no success. Some of them feel they were wrongly accused and wish to return home. Some dragorn, most of the best fighters in the lands, were blackmailed or brainwashed into joining Mata Muram's legion. How did this come about? Mata Muram made use of Bealu's planar creation, the Riftseekers, which were granted to him for travel between worlds and to seed Discord into as many realms as possible. Mata Muram is a slave trader who conquers large numbers of races, inducting the best fighters into his own legion and selling the rest to other worlds. He has since taken up residence in Anguish, the Fallen Palace, a massive structure hidden in the mountains of the northeast."

		"plot": "Mayong Mistmoore's release into godhood has turned the gods' focus back to the mortal realm. Druzzil Ro foresaw the devastation of the world and in turn beckoned all mortals to her Plane of Magic, a plane ruled by her creations, the scrykin. The scrykin have a problem, though. As they age, they succumb to madness, paranoia, and instability -- something which led the first born scrykin, Daosheen, to lock himself in the tower of Skylance. As the elder scrykin continued to deteriorate mentally, the dragons of Relic assumed more political power. They, however, are at odds one another as they each want control of the magical channeling platforms built within the city. And so it is the second born scrykin, Porthio, who has assumed the role as governor of Relic while at the same time remaining focused on his studies. In addition to the Plane of Magic portal, another passage appeared in Freeport, one which leads to the home of Sullon Zek -- the Plane of Rage. It is said that when one mortal kills another in a fit of rage, the killer is sent here when they die. The Seething Wall which lines the plane covers the killer in an all-consuming darkness. They feel cold, leathery flesh, and the pinch and scrape of armor against their bodies, crushing them from every direction. With the stench of death in the cold air and the calling of Sullon Zek's rage, they soon feel an urgent need to destroy and vent their unrelenting rage, as well as a desire to fight for Sullon Zek and earn her respect. Sullon Zek remains in the tower of Razorthorn within her plane's stronghold, alongside those who are most dedicated to increasing their rage and learning how to focus it. Another magical passage formed in the Desert of Ro. Druzzil Ro wasn't the only god to take action after Mayong Mistmoore was released into godhood. Tunare, too, saw the need to beckon mortals to her realm. Using rains from Karana and magic from Druzzil Ro, a sandstorm was created in the desert, revealing the ruins of the Elddar city Takish-Hiz. Also created was a portal into the past and the glory of the Elddar Forest and great elven city as it stood in the Age of Monuments, before Solusek Ro created the Serpent's Spine Mountains and turned the forest into a desert. There is one god who has already fallen to the corruption of Mayong Mistmoore. She is Ayonae Ro, the ruler of the once-beautiful Plane of Music, a place which has turned into a dark, bloody cesspool of terror and rage while Ayonae remains holed up in the plane's tower of Deathknell. The very power of mortals that the gods despised for unleashing Mayong Mistmoore into godhood is being called upon to save them and the world."

The force of her entry has torn an invisible seam that binds together countless realities, exposing what ancient texts refer to as Ethernere. Without knowing how or why the dragon oracle arrived in their world, many Norrathians view Lady Lendiniara as a threat, while others interpret her arrival to mean the end of times is near. Factions begin to form, some prophesizing the demise of the world, and others uniting to confront the dragon invader. Whether this winged harbinger is friend or foe, one thing is certain â€“ she did not travel through Ethernere alone. There is only one within this world who possesses the knowledge to send Lady Lendiniara back to her home, but can you really trust the ramblings of a madman? In your quest to send Lady Lendiniara back to her world, you will travel to many previously undiscovered areas within Norrath, searching for artifacts of great power, while also encountering familiar faces many thought to be lost in time. With Lady Lendiniara's presence threatening the existence of Norrath, an unlikely alliance has been forged with The Forsaken to send the dangerous dragon home. At Zebuxorukâ€™s request, the bravest will fight their way through recently discovered lands to recover magical artifacts that contain the power to return Lady Lendiniara to her world. Adventurers will face adversaries at every turn, from those who refuse to release the magical artifacts, to others who are determined to see the dragon dead at all costs. Before all comes to a close, a familiar face will emerge with a new directive, leaving the fate of Norrath with one decision: Will you put your trust in the sly speech of a Teir'Dal or the endless ramblings of a madman? In time, you would encounter a rather angry Undead Lord by the name of Kyle Bayle, the apparent long-dead leader of the original ill-fated Qeynos expedition into the Dead Hills many years prior. While you managed to defeat Kyle Bayle's Captain and Sergeants, the Undead Lord managed to retreat back into his tower. A hot ash wind is blowing from the portals that have appeared in Ethernere-Tainted West Karana and South Ro. Creatures of ash have ventured out of the portals and are roaming menacingly throughout South Ro and North Ro. Guards from Freeport have come here to bring order to this region and are beseeching powerful adventurers to travel here to assist with quelling the blaze. Lanys T`vyl is waiting for you in the Ethernere-Tainted West Karana. She would like for you to further investigate this situation. The last artifact needed to send Lady Lendiniara back to her home may be located beyond the ash portals that have appeared in these areas, and the only way to know for sure is to gather other powerful allies to your side to investigate for yourself."
